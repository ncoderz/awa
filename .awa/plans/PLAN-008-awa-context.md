# `awa context` — Intelligent Context Assembly (SUPERSEDED)

STATUS: completed
DIRECTION: top-down

## Context

This plan has been MERGED INTO PLAN-002 (`awa trace`). The two plans shared ~70% of their implementation (TraceIndex building, chain walking, ID resolution) and differed only in output format (locations vs. content). The merged plan adds `--content`, `--task`, `--file`, `--max-tokens`, `--clipboard`, and `--list` modes to `awa trace`.

See: .awa/plans/PLAN-002-awa-trace.md

## Change Log

- 001 (2026-03-01): Initial plan
- 002 (2026-03-01): Superseded — merged into PLAN-002 (awa trace)
