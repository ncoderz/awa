**awa** (Agent Workflow for AIs) is an open-source CLI tool for structured, traceable AI-assisted development. It enforces a Software Design Document (SDD) workflow with full end-to-end traceability, validated by `awa check` and navigable via `awa trace`. Agent configuration files are bootstrapped from templates with feature flags.

## The Problem

AI agents produce output that looks right but isn't connected. Requirements live in one place, implementation in another, tests in a third — nothing links them. The AI doesn't know when it has drifted from the original intent. You don't either, until something breaks.

Agent configuration files diverge too: copy-pasted between projects, modified by hand, silently out of date.

## The Solution

awa provides a structured SDD workflow:

```
ARCHITECTURE → FEAT → REQUIREMENTS → DESIGN → TASKS → CODE & TESTS → DOCUMENTATION
```

Every artifact carries an explicit traceability marker (`@awa-impl`, `@awa-test`, `@awa-component`) linking it to its originating requirement and acceptance criterion. Any line of code traces back to why it was written. Any requirement traces forward to the tests that verify it.

`awa check` enforces this chain — validating spec structure via YAML schemas and ensuring every acceptance criterion maps to code and tests. `awa trace` assembles the chain into context so AI agents navigate with confidence rather than guessing.

Agent configuration files are bootstrapped from **templates** with **feature flags** — making the SDD workflow available in any project immediately.

## Key Features

### SDD & Traceability

- Structured SDD workflow from architecture through documentation
- Requirements written in [EARS format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Approach_to_Requirements_Syntax) (INCOSE) — structured, testable, unambiguous
- Every requirement has an ID; every line of code links back via `@awa-impl` and `@awa-test` markers
- `awa check` validates spec structure via YAML schemas and flags uncovered acceptance criteria
- `awa trace` assembles context from specs, code, and tests for AI agents
- Spec artifacts (requirements, designs, tasks, plans, rules) all live in `.awa/`

### Template Bootstrap

- [Eta](https://eta.js.org/) templates with conditionals, loops, and partials
- Feature flags and presets to turn content on/off per project
- `awa template diff` shows exactly what changed before you commit
- `awa template features` discovers all feature flags in a template
- `awa template test` verifies templates against test fixtures and snapshots
- Template overlays to layer customizations over a base template
- Multi-target configuration for generating different agent setups in one command
- Pull templates from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or use a local path
- Optional `.awa.toml` config, or just use CLI flags

## Philosophy

> awa was written by awa — AI-assisted development using its own workflows. The workflows themselves are designed and crafted by a human who uses Copilot. If something is wrong, let's fix it together.

awa is **agent-agnostic**: it generates configuration for GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and more — all from a single template set. It makes no assumptions about which AI tool you use or how you use it.
