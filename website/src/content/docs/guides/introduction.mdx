**awa** (Agent Workflow for AIs) is an open-source CLI tool that generates AI coding agent configuration files from templates with feature flags. It solves the problem of AI agent configuration drift and lack of traceability in AI-assisted development.

## The Problem

Developing with AI agents requires process. Configuration files that define this process get copy-pasted between projects, then diverge. Requirements live in one place, implementation in another, tests in a third — nothing connects them. They diverge too.

Without structure, work drifts and nobody — including the AI — can trace what happened or why.

## The Solution

awa generates agent configuration files from **templates** with **feature flags**. The generated output includes a spec-driven development workflow with full traceability:

```
ARCHITECTURE → FEAT → REQUIREMENTS → DESIGN → TASKS → CODE & TESTS → DOCUMENTATION
```

Every artifact traces back to its origin through explicit markers (`@awa-impl`, `@awa-test`, `@awa-component`). Any line of code traces back to the requirement that motivated it. Any requirement traces forward to the tests that verify it.

## Key Features

### Workflow & Traceability

- Structured workflow from architecture through features, requirements, design, tasks, code, tests, and docs
- Requirements written in [EARS format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Approach_to_Requirements_Syntax) (INCOSE) — structured, testable, unambiguous
- Every requirement has an ID; every line of code links back to it via `@awa-impl` and `@awa-test` markers
- `awa check` checks that all traceability markers resolve to real spec IDs and flags uncovered acceptance criteria
- Spec artifacts (requirements, designs, tasks, plans, rules) all live in `.awa/`

### CLI & Template Engine

- [Eta](https://eta.js.org/) templates with conditionals, loops, and partials
- Feature flags and presets to turn content on/off per project
- `awa template diff` shows exactly what changed before you commit
- `awa template features` discovers all feature flags in a template
- `awa template test` verifies templates against test fixtures and snapshots
- Template overlays to layer customizations over a base template
- Multi-target configuration for generating different agent setups in one command
- Pull templates from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or use a local path
- Optional `.awa.toml` config, or just use CLI flags

## Philosophy

> awa was written by awa — AI-assisted development using its own workflows. The workflows themselves are designed and crafted by a human who uses Copilot. If something is wrong, let's fix it together.

awa is **agent-agnostic**: it generates configuration for GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and more — all from a single template set. It makes no assumptions about which AI tool you use or how you use it.
