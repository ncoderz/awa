import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Get up and running with awa in just a few minutes.

## Install

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Global install">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @ncoderz/awa
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npx (no install)">
    ```bash
    npx @ncoderz/awa init
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Generate Agent Configuration Files

awa's core value: one command generates AI agent configuration files for every tool your team uses — GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, and more — from a single template.

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to your project**

   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Generate files using the default awa template**

   ```bash
   awa init
   ```

   This generates agent configuration files into the current directory using awa's bundled default template.

3. **Generate with specific AI tool features**

   ```bash
   awa init --features copilot claude cursor
   ```

   Feature flags control which sections are included. Enable only what you need.

4. **Preview before writing (dry run)**

   ```bash
   awa init --dry-run
   ```

5. **Discover available features**

   ```bash
   awa template features
   ```

   Lists all feature flags available in the template.

6. **Check for drift after a template update**

   ```bash
   awa template diff .
   ```

   See what would change in your project if you re-generated from the latest template.

</Steps>

## Common Usage Patterns

### Using a Preset

```bash
# Enable all supported AI tools
awa init --preset full

# Enable a subset
awa init --preset full --remove-features roo agy
```

### Using a Custom Template

```bash
# From a local directory
awa init --template ./my-templates

# From a GitHub repository
awa init --template owner/repo

# From a specific branch or tag
awa init --template owner/repo#v1.0.0
```

### Using a Config File

Create `.awa.toml` in your project root:

```toml
output = ".github/agents"
template = "owner/repo"
features = ["copilot", "claude"]
```

Then simply run:

```bash
awa init
```

## What Gets Generated

By default, awa generates files into the project root (configurable). These typically include:

- Agent instruction files (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`)
- Prompt files in `.github/prompts/`
- Workflow skills in `.github/skills/`

The exact output depends on your template and feature flags.

## Traceability and the awa Workflow

`awa check` and `awa trace` are separate from template generation — they are used when following the [awa structured workflow](/guides/workflow/) for spec-driven development.

- **`awa check`** — validates that traceability markers in your code reference real spec IDs, and flags uncovered acceptance criteria. Run this as part of your structured development workflow, not as part of template setup.
- **`awa trace <ID>`** — assembles the full trace for a requirement or component: spec text, implementation, and tests in one view. Useful when working on a feature or investigating coverage.

```bash
# Check traceability coverage across your codebase
awa check

# Trace a specific requirement or component
awa trace FEAT-1
```

These commands require spec files (`.awa/specs/`) to be present. See the [Workflow Guide](/guides/workflow/) for how to set up the full awa development workflow.
