## What is awa?

**awa** is an Agent Workflow for AIs. It provides a Spec-Driven Design (SDD) workflow with full end-to-end traceability, with tools to enforced consistency and help the AI follow the connections. It is also a powerful templating tool for agent configuration files.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Structured SDD Workflow" icon="rocket">
    Architecture → Features → Requirements → Design → Tasks → Code & Tests → Documentation. Every stage has a spec. Every spec has an ID.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Traceability" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Every line of code traces back to its requirement via `@awa-impl` and `@awa-test` markers. Nothing drifts silently.
  </Card>
  <Card title="awa check" icon="magnifier">
    Validates spec structure via YAML schemas and verifies all AC markers map to code and tests. AI can't hide broken coverage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="awa trace" icon="open-book">
    Assembles the traceability chain into context — specs, code, and tests — so AI navigates with confidence rather than guessing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Template Bootstrap" icon="puzzle">
    [Eta](https://eta.js.org/) templates with feature flags and presets generate agent configuration files for any AI tool — Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and more.

  <Card title="Template Diffs" icon="warning">
    `awa template diff` shows exactly what has changed in your agent configuration files vs. the templates — before you commit to update.

    One template set. All agents. Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and more from a single source of truth.

## The Problem: AI Drift

AI agents produce output that looks right but isn't connected. Requirements live in one place, implementation in another, tests in a third — nothing links them. The AI doesn't know when it has drifted from the original intent. You don't either, until something breaks.

Agent configuration files diverge too: copy-pasted between projects, modified by hand, silently out of date.

## How awa Solves It

awa provides a structured SDD workflow with full traceability:

```
ARCHITECTURE → FEAT → REQUIREMENTS → DESIGN → TASKS → CODE & TESTS → DOCUMENTATION
```

`awa check` enforces spec structure and validates that every acceptance criterion maps to code and tests. `awa trace` assembles context from the chain so AI can navigate rather than guess. Agent configuration files are bootstrapped from templates.
