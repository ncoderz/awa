## What is awa?

**awa** (Agent Workflow for AIs) is a CLI tool that generates AI coding agent configuration files via templates with feature flags. It enforces a structured development workflow (awa's or yours) with full traceability from requirements through to tests.


<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Structured Workflow" icon="rocket">
    Guide your AI through every stage: Architecture → Features → Requirements → Design → Tasks → Code & Tests → Documentation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Traceability" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Every line of code traces back to the requirement that motivated it via `@awa-impl` and `@awa-test` markers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Template AI Files" icon="puzzle">
    Use [Eta](https://eta.js.org/) templates with conditionals, loops, and partials. Enable or disable content with feature flags and presets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Drift Detection" icon="magnifier">
    `awa diff` shows exactly what has changed in your agent configuration files vs. the templates — before you commit.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Traceability Validation" icon="approve-check-circle">
    `awa validate` checks that all code markers resolve to real spec IDs and flags uncovered acceptance criteria.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Git or Local" icon="open-book">
    Pull templates from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or use a local path. Cached locally for fast re-runs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent-Agnostic" icon="laptop">
    Generate configuration for Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and more — all from a single template set.

## The Problem: Divergence

Developing with AI agents requires process. Configuration files that define this process get copy-pasted between projects, then diverge. Requirements live in one place, implementation in another, tests in a third — nothing connects them. They diverge too.

Without structure, work drifts and nobody, including the AI, can trace what happened or why.

## How awa Solves It

awa generates agent configuration files from **templates** with **feature flags**. Every artifact traces back to its origin through explicit markers:

```
ARCHITECTURE → FEAT → REQUIREMENTS → DESIGN → TASKS → CODE & TESTS → DOCUMENTATION
```
