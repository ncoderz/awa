## Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 25 February 2026

### CLI Tool

awa is a local command-line tool. It does **not**:

- Collect personal data
- Send telemetry or analytics
- Phone home or make network requests beyond fetching templates you explicitly request from Git hosting providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

### Website

This documentation website is hosted on GitHub Pages.

- **No cookies** are set by this site.
- **No analytics** are collected by us.
- GitHub Pages may collect basic server logs (IP address, user agent) as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Third-Party Services

When using `awa template generate` or `awa template diff` with a Git template source, awa fetches templates from the hosting provider you specify. Those requests are subject to the provider's own privacy policy.

### Changes

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted to this page.

### Contact

For questions, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ncoderz/awa/issues).
